# keylogger
# Add this Key-log + Screenshot python combo to your bag of trojans

# Combine these two exploits, or add them to an already written shellcode; use a phishing scheme, and watch your victims screenshots and key inputs. 
# There is a chance the attacker (user) might have to modify code to fit their own situation. This is not a one size fits all exploit.

### Thanks and Happy Hacking!!
